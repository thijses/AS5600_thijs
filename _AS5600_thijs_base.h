    after a START, in response to an address byte, the slave uses ACK if (TWEA=1) it accepts the communication in general
    during data transferrence (either direction) the ACK/NOT-ACK is used to let the other side know whether or not they want more data
    if the recipient sends an ACK, it expects more data
    if the master transmitter ran out of data to send to the slave receiver, the slave status register will read 0xA0 (twi_SR_S_STOP_RESTART)
    if the slave transmitter ran out of data to send to the master receiver, the slave status register will read 0xC8 (twi_SR_S_DAT_STL_ACK)
        in that case, the slave transmitter will send all 1's untill STOP (or RESTART)
    in cases where there is too much data (from either side), the NOT-ACK will just be received earlier than expected
        if the slave sends NOT-ACK early, the master should STOP/RESTART the transmission (or the slave should ignore the overflowing data)
        if the master sends NOT-ACK early, the slave doesnt have to do anything (except maybe raise an error internally)
    
    in general, the TWEA (Enable Ack) bit should be synchronized in both devices (except for master transmitter, which doesnt use it).
    in master receiver, TWEA signals to the slave that the last byte is received, and the transmission will end
    in both slave modes, if TWEA==0, the slave expects for there to be a STOP/RESTART next 'tick', if not, the status register will read 0 (twi_SR_bus_err)

    /*
    The ESP32 is both fantastically fast, and absolutely bogged down at the same time.
    The core itself runs wicked fast, so actual math is no problem.
    But interfacing with peripherals is often slow (because of the Real Time Operating System ?)
    Unfortunately, optimizing code by using low-level instructions is rarely easy, as there are always at least 3 'low' levels.
    In the case of I2C there is the arduino compatibility layer (top???): wire.begin(), etc.
    which is based on the HAL layer: i2cInit(), see esp32-hal-i2c.h in the core in Arduino15 in %appData%
    and below that there are some functions as well: i2c_driver_install() and i2c_master_cmd_begin(), see https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/i2c.html
    there is a layer below that: https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/components/driver/i2c.c
    but it's badly documented, hard to read and very RTOS-optimized. I don't think i'm quite ready to unravel that thread (for a few microseconds of extra speed)
    
    The code does not appear to be very fast (an atmega328p can do twoWireReadTwoBytes() in ~80us and the ESP needs ~128us)
    using twoWireOnlyReadTwoBytes is ~34us faster, so if you're willing to risk (your code requiring some thought), you may get away with that
    The recommended method is to use a i2c_cmd_handle_t, but that slows things down SO DAMN MUCH.
    There are some options for timing customizations, and i spotted a ~10us solid LOW gap in the SCL signal, so there may be some time to be saved there.
    
    note: the frequency is significantly lower than you set it. Add stronger pullups to SDA and SCL to increase speed closer to desired (but never quite there).
            adding 4.7K pullups makes it so 1MHz requested == 750kHz real
            the signal curves looked like they could do with even lower resistance pullups, in the AS5600 datasheet they vaguely mention 20mA "Logic low output current"
    
    TBD:
        returning esp_err_t instead of boolean for most functions (while maintaining compatiblity with arduino.?.)
        const command links instead of making new ones?
        the ESP32 documentation states you "have to" delete them, but i tested it and you can reuse a command just fine...
          (note: after switching to static CMDs, it seems that constant/predefined commands would (at most!) save about 6us, while making the library a whole lot stupider)

    /* Notes on the STM32 I2C perihperal (specifically that of the STM32WB55):
    Much like the ESP32, the STM32 libraries are built on several layers of abstraction.
    The twi.h library goes to some HAL library, and i have no intention of finding out where it goes from there.
    Since this particular implementation does not need to be terribly fast, i'll just stick with twi.h,
     which does have the advantage of working with the whole STM32 family (whereas a lower implementation would target specific subfamilies)
    The STM32 can map the I2C pins to a limited (but at least more than one) selection of pins,
     see PeripheralPins.c for the PinMap_I2C_SDA and PinMap_I2C_SCL (or just look at the datasheet)
     (for my purposes, that's: .platformio\packages\framework-arduinoststm32\variants\STM32WBxx\WB55R(C-E-G)V\PeripheralPins.c )
     Here is a handy little table:
      I2C1: SDA: PA10, PB7, PB9
            SCL: PA9, PB6, PB8
      I2C3: SDA: PB4, PB11, PB14, PC1
            SCL: PA7, PB10, PB13, PC0
